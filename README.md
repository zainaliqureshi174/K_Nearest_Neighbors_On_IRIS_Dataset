# K_Nearest_Neighbors_On_IRIS_Dataset
This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the Iris dataset to classify flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. By training on labeled data, the model predicts the species of new samples based on the closest data points, demonstrating KNN's efficiency in classification tasks.
